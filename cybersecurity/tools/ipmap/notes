ipmap.py maps IP addresses to countries from an Nginx access.log file, which is
assumed to be in the same directory as ipmap.py.

It also depends on a database of IP addresses: dbip*.csv. You can copy the
access.log file from cybersecurity/data/access.log.

Once ipmap.py, dbip*.csv and access.log are in the same directory, run with:

python ipmap.py
